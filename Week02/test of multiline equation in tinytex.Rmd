## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{eqnarray} -->
<!-- a^2 + b^2 &=& c^2 \\ -->
<!-- &=& 5 -->
<!-- \end{eqnarray} -->
<!-- $$ -->

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
  \dot{y} & = \rho x- y - xz 
\end{aligned}
$$


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
